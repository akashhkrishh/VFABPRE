Yogurt is a fermented dairy product made by adding bacterial cultures to milk, which ferment the lactose and produce lactic acid, giving yogurt its tangy flavor and creamy texture. It is a good source of protein, calcium, probiotics, and vitamins, and is often consumed as a nutritious snack or breakfast food. Yogurt can be eaten plain or flavored, and is commonly used in cooking and baking.
